# Typing Duel

Welcome to typing Duel app, this is a final project for lighthouse labs. 

Itâ€™s an Single Page app that allows you to practice typing and optionally compete with other users.

For technologies - our frontend is written in React.  The backend is Rails with a Postgres  database.  We also utilize websockets for the game competition functionality.



## React + Rails No-Fluff Boilerplate
This boillerplate is created and provided by Lighthouse Labs.

A boilerplate project for anyone interested in making a project that uses React and Rails.

Note! This boilerplate has _no fluff_! That means that there's nothing set up for you to do authentication stuff, there's no Redux stuff, and there's no React Router stuff.

The main important bit is that the React project has `proxy` set to `localhost:3001` in the `package.json` file. Take a look!



## Set up and running for the app


You need **Three** terminals for this app.

## Ruby Backend server command

In one terminal in the root directory, run `bundle install` to install the dependencies. Run `bin/rake db:setup` to create the databases (called rails_project_development by default). Run `bin/rails s` to run the server.

## Websocket server command

Use seconde terminal under 'websocket server' directory, run "npm install" to install the dependencies.

- npm start

Use above command to start webSockets server for competitive mode.

## Frontend command

Use third termial under 'client' directory, run "npm install" to install the dependncies.

- npm start

Use above command to start front end browser, go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.




## commands for granting privileges to psql roles

- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE lhl_final_development TO labber;

- ALTER USER labber WITH SUPERUSER

- We have to put the database.yml in the gitignore if we don't want to push it to the master. so we should all agree on what role we want to share or put the file in the git ignore
